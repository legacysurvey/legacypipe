# Building Docker container for use with Shifter at NERSC, using the Intel compilers

This uses the Intel compilers, which introduces two complications:
-   you need to access the license server at NERSC to build

-   the intel compilers cannot be distributed, therefore can't be posted to Docker Hub,
    so NERSC provides a "two-stage build" recipe where you build in a full container, and
    then copy your results into a container with just the freely-distributable runtime
    components of the Intel suite.

Preliminaries:

-   create an account at <https://hub.docker.com>
-   ask someone to add you to the `legacysurvey` organization on Docker Hub.

First, set up your `~/.ssh/config` file, adding a stanza called `intel-license`:

    Host intel-license
    Hostname cori.nersc.gov
    GatewayPorts yes
    LocalForward 28519 intel.licenses.nersc.gov:28519
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/nersc
    IdentitiesOnly yes

Second, run `sshproxy` if you haven't already done so today.

Third, run the `build.sh` script:

    (cd docker-nersc && ./build.sh)

Note that the `build.sh` script tags the build as
`legacysurvey/legacypipe:nersc`.  This is a Docker Hub name;
see <https://hub.docker.com/r/legacysurvey/legacypipe/tags> for
tagged builds there.

Fourth, push the built container to Docker Hub:

    docker push legacysurvey/legacypipe:nersc

You may need to log in to Docker hub first:

    docker login

first.

Fifth, back at NERSC, pull the new container down from Docker Hub:

    shifterimg pull docker:legacysurvey/legacypipe:nersc

Run it via:

    shifter --image docker:legacysurvey/legacypipe:nersc bash

## Notes about DR8

For DR8, we have a series of tags of the `legacypipe` repo and the Docker containers.

These were done by, eg:

    cd legacypipe/docker-nersc
    git tag -a DR8.0.2
    git push --tags
    ./build.sh
    # Copy the tag
    docker tag legacysurvey/legacypipe:nersc legacysurvey/legacypipe:nersc-dr8.0.2
    docker push legacysurvey/legacypipe:nersc-dr8.0.2
